---@module 'rules.engine.runner'
---@brief Run one rule family (by ID prefix) against a root path.
---@description
--- Deliberately one family at a time, never "every loaded rule at once" — a
--- whole-catalog sweep in one command is exactly the shape that produced an
--- unreadable, multi-hour report in the real dry run this plugin is modeled
--- on (see the P5 write-up linked from the concept doc). `:Rules check` is
--- built on this one function precisely so it cannot offer that shortcut.

local checks = require("rules.engine.checks")

local M = {}

---@class Rules.Result
---@field rule Rules.ParsedRule
---@field status "pass"|"fail"|"error"|"manual"
---@field findings Rules.Finding[]

--- The family of a rule id: its leading letters, e.g. "DEP" for "DEP-01".
---@param id string
---@return string
function M.family_of(id)
  return id:match("^(%a+)%-") or id
end

--- Run every rule whose family matches `family_prefix` against `root`.
---@param rules Rules.ParsedRule[]
---@param family_prefix string
---@param root string
---@return Rules.Result[]
function M.check_family(rules, family_prefix, root)
  local results = {}
  for _, rule in ipairs(rules) do
    if M.family_of(rule.id) == family_prefix then
      local status, findings = checks.run(rule.check, root)
      results[#results + 1] = { rule = rule, status = status, findings = findings }
    end
  end
  return results
